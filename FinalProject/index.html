            <div id='title'>Celebration of African Hair
                By: Jola Adebiyi </div>

                Originally I had a plan to show various hairstyles for this art 
                piece, but I decided that the best way to fully appreciate 
                African hair is to show its natural curls. I wondered how I 
                could do that but also make the piece stand out in a certain 
                type of way. 
                As you can see there are words around this black woman's Afro. 
                I wrote the word hair several times around her Afro to symbolize 
                what I was celebrating in this piece. Afros were seen, and may 
                still be seen, as unruly or unkept. So I tried my best in this 
                piece to symbolize elegance in this Afro and show its beauty 
                in a different way.
